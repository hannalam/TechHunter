#### Agile Software Project from University of London

The purpose of this project is to create a mobile app in which recent graduates can find their
first job and recruiters/companies can find their next junior. Because of the high demand for
skilled technology workers, the relatively high salaries, good company benefits and interesting
work, the recruitment process has evolved into something quite different as it was many years
ago, and several pain points have developed.

The vision of this project is to provide a tech job matching platform for this particular industry
segment in order to help users find their target faster and accurately. The job matching platform,
called TechHunter, provides a direct connection between the candidates and recruiters if both
parties' requirements are aligned, which eases this process by filtering out most of the irrelevant
opportunities.
